# Exercise 4: external data sets: Gates Foundation Educational Grants

# Use the `read.csv()` functoin to read the data from the `data/gates_money.csv`
# file into a variable called `grants` using the `read.csv()`
# Be sure to set your working directory in RStudio, and do NOT treat strings as 
# factors!
data <- read.csv("data/gates_money.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Use the View function to look at the loaded data
View(data)

# Create a variable `organization` that contains the `organization` column of 
# the dataset
organization <- data[,"organization"]

# Confirm that the "organization" column is a vector using the `is.vector()` 
# function. 
# This is a useful debugging tip if you hit errors later!
is.vector("organization")

## Now you can ask some interesting questions about the dataset

# What was the mean grant value?
mean_grant <- mean(data$total_amount)

# What was the dollar amount of the largest grant?
largest_grant <- max(data$total_amount)

# What was the dollar amount of the smallest grant?
smallest_grant <- min(data$total_amount)

# Which organization received the largest grant?
large_organization <- data[data$total_amount == largest_grant, "organization"]

# Which organization received the smallest grant?
smallest_organization <- data[data$total_amount == smallest_grant, "organization"]

# How many grants were awarded in 2010?
total_awarded_2010 <- length(data$total_amount[data$start_year == "2010"])
